  Java uses objects and classes to structure programs, improving reusability and maintainability.

- **Automatic Memory Management:**  
  The *Garbage Collector (GC)* automatically removes unused objects from memory.

- **Rich Standard Library:**  
  Java provides thousands of built-in classes for networking, data structures, I/O, and more.
